      Decentralization vs Commercialization: The Evolution and Impact of
      Externally Owned and Abstracted Accounts
    </h1>
    <p>16 September 2023</p>
    <p>
      Every technological epoch introduces a game-changing shift that
      revolutionizes our digital interactions. The birth of email was such a
      transformative moment, anchoring our online identity and revolutionizing
      communication. The widespread adoption of wallets controlling
      Externally-owned Accounts (EOAs) signals a similar leap in the
      decentralized digital world, empowering users with the keys to their
      digital— and potentially physical—lives. While each step forward brings
      its own advantages and challenges, each trail blazes with short-term
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Email ushered in an era of personalized online experiences. EOAs follow a
      similar tale, guaranteeing custom engagements within and beyond
      Blockchains. Their widespread adoption means users now comfortably manage
      their own keys. However, this scenario also uncovers certain motivations:
      major players keen to continue their growth, and struggling players keen
      to spark &amp; retain growth, are motivated to use Abstracted Accounts to
      tether users to their ecosystems. Gnosis, a key player in the Ethereum
      field, recently championed the cause of onboarding users onto Ethereum
      &quot;by any means necessary,&quot; nudging our Overton window towards
      proprietary methods and walled gardens. This shift highlights an emerging
      conflict that goes beyond user experience. At its heart, it&#39;s a battle
      between the fundamental ethos of decentralization, which offers unique
      benefits to users, and the aspirations of newly-established incumbents to
      monetize blockspace over all else.
    </p>
    <p>
      We currently, via EOAs, have the power to deliver personalized experiences
      for each user, similar to individual email accounts, but without
      jeopardizing personal data or user security. Abstracted Accounts can
      intensify this personalization, delivering an exceptional user-centric
      experience. However, such specialization has its hurdles. The varied rules
      linked to these accounts could lead to a fragmented Wallet space, with
      myriad user pockets each limited to their accounts&#39; capabilities. And
      while the adaptability of Abstracted Accounts allows for refined user
      flows—akin to streamlined email providers—they can also be misused. The
      lurking danger is that such flexibility could marginalize specific
      accounts, creating digital gatekeeping and a significant avenue for
      centralization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as tailored email clients dazzle with their feature sets, optimized
      AAs have the potential to excel in specific contexts. But this
      optimization has a catch. Users may lose funds if contracts are not
      deployed across networks, and may projects deployed to certain chains may
      face de-facto censorship as a result. Such constraints could hinder the
      immense potential of the decentralized world if this type of account does
      end up dominating. As they evolve to introduce more features, the
      resulting complexity might also usher in unexpected vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, the evolution of email was a layered journey, with its learning
      curves and complexity, and ultimately, the loss of
      <em>freedom to choose</em>. Major email service providers may now filter
      out emails originating from a server which is not a part of the
      non-transparent list of trusted providers. This was likely done with the
      very very best of intentions (spam &amp; phishing protection), yet we are
      now faced with a world where email protocols cannot be treated as
      open—instead we have a cabal of providers. <em>Web3</em>&#39;s mission has
      to be to learn from these lessons, grapple with the risks of
      centralisation, and understand that &quot;improving UX&quot; is not a
      brush that can sweep away all of our current frustrations. Improving UX is
      nuanced, and involved making concerted efforts to understand and
      <em>properly</em> address user problems. EOAs are the future, and work
      must continue to both support the wallets that provide EOA functionality,
      and at a protocol level understand how to introduce things we are
      confident users require—no matter how insurmountable the challenges may
      seem (key rotation capabilities, sponsored transactions).

      While I personally do believe that Abstracted Accounts offer significant
      near term benefit, I also believe this is because wallets and
      wallet-related tooling is severely lacking in quality. Users are
      consistently unable to connect to mobile wallets. Users consistently
      receive ghost notifications to sign messages. Users do not have full app
      capabilities to enable them to sign messages in-context. Users are forced
      to install a myriad of wallets. Users are forced to deal with sup-par
      experiences provided by sub-par software. Meanwhile, middlewares are
      already digging their moat around their previously-open infrastructure. If
      this is the current state of affairs, we cannot fall into the collective
      delusion that Abstracted Accounts will be a magic bullet. Much like
      Ethereum L1 <em>may</em> become intrinsically tied to Lido, SAFE
      intrinsically tied WorldCoin via the 2 million SAFE contracts that were
      deployed to Optimism, etc, we cannot allow ourselves to become a victim of
      short-term incentives in lieu of hard, often subjective, work. The
      collective choices we make today will determine if the ecosystem stays
      true to its core decentralization principles or gradually shifts towards
      outright commercialization—and the concentration risk that comes with it.
