      Decentralization vs Commercialization: The Evolution and Impact of
      Externally Owned and Abstracted Accounts
    </h1>
    <p>16 September 2023</p>
    <p>
      Every technological epoch introduces a game-changing shift that
      revolutionizes our digital interactions. The birth of email was such a
      transformative moment, anchoring our online identity and revolutionizing
      communication. The widespread adoption of wallets controlling
      Externally-owned Accounts (EOAs) signals a similar leap in the
      decentralized digital world, empowering users with the keys to their
      digital—and potentially physical—lives. While each step forward brings its
      own advantages and challenges, each trail blazes with short-term
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Email ushered in an era of personalized online experiences. EOAs follow a
      similar tale, providing new ways for users to interact within and beyond
      Blockchains. Their widespread adoption means users now comfortably manage
      their own keys. However, this scenario also uncovers certain motivations:
      major players keen to continue their growth, and struggling players keen
      to spark &amp; retain growth. They are incentivized to use Abstracted
      Accounts to tether users to their ecosystems. Gnosis recently championed
      the cause of onboarding users onto Ethereum &quot;by any means
      necessary,&quot; nudging our Overton window towards proprietary methods
      and walled gardens. To further compound this, numerous projects arise each
      year, built around storing keys in the browser in the name of "abstracting
      away signing", to get users through the door. This shift highlights an
      emerging conflict that goes beyond user experience. At its heart, it&#39;s
      a battle between the fundamental ethos of decentralization, which offers
      unique benefits to users versus:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        the aspirations of newly-established incumbents to monetize blockspace
        over all else,
      </li>
      <li>
        the desire of new entrants to get people into their application by any
        means necessary.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We currently, via EOAs, have the power to deliver personalized experiences
      for each user, in a similar way to individual email accounts, but without
      jeopardizing personal data or user security. Abstracted Accounts can
      provide significantly more abilities, and deliver an exceptional
      user-centric experience. However, with specialization comes a lack of
      adaptability. The varied rules linked to these accounts may lead to a
      fragmented Wallet space, with a myriad of user pockets each limited to
      their accounts&#39; capabilities. And while the adaptability of Abstracted
      Accounts allows for refined user flows—akin to streamlined email
      providers—they can also be misused. The lurking danger is that such
      flexibility could accidentally <i>or deliberately</i> marginalize accounts
      types. Another way to phrase this is that they enable gatekeeping, and are
      a significant avenue for centralization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users may lose funds if contracts are not deployed across networks. Users
      may not be able to access projects if they aren't deployed on the same
      networks. Signing off-chain data becomes more convoluted than we have
      already made it. Projects and users may face de-facto censorship, and it
      further compounds confusion.
    </p>
    <p><i>"My friend can do this, why can't I?"</i></p>
    <p>
      Accounts may be permissioned in such a way to enforce compliance, and be
      limited to specific jurisdictions. Censorship. The proliferation of
      accounts which have these capabilities could hinder the immense potential
      of the decentralized world, and a precedent for this practice—attempting
      to placate regulators—has recently been set by Privacy Pools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evolution of email is analogous. The ways around the learning curves
      that came with its emergence ultimately led to the loss of
      <em>freedom to choose</em>. Self-hosting was deemed too hard, and ISPs
      effectively outlawed running home servers in a bid to control traffic. As
      a result, users have to work with a hosting provider or request (and pay
      for) a static IP. But to further compound this, major email service
      providers actively filter out emails originating from somebody who they do
      not deem trustworthy, such as those with self-hosted mailservers. While I
      imagine that this was done with the very very best of intentions, as most
      things are, we are now faced with a world where email protocols cannot be
      treated as open, and instead we have a cabal of providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Web3</em>&#39;s mission must be to learn from these lessons, grapple
      with the risks of centralization, and understand that &quot;improving
      UX&quot; is not a brush that can sweep away all of our current
      frustrations. Improving UX is nuanced, involving making concerted efforts
      to understand and <em>properly</em> address user problems. EOAs will,
      regardless, remain in our future, and work must continue to both support
      the wallets that provide EOA functionality, and at a protocol level
      understand what we need to introduce to help our users, no matter how
      insurmountable the challenges may seem: key rotation capabilities,
      sponsored transactions, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I do believe that Abstracted Accounts offer significant
      near-term benefit, it's my conviction that this opportunity exists because
      the wallet &amp; wallet-related-tooling space is severely lacking in
      quality. Users are consistently unable to connect to mobile wallets. Users
      consistently receive ghost notifications to sign messages. Users do not
      have full app capabilities to enable them to sign messages in-context.
      Users are forced to install a myriad of wallets. Users are forced to deal
      with sup-par experiences provided by sub-par software. Meanwhile,
      middlewares are already digging their moat around their previously-open
      infrastructure. If this is the current state of affairs, we cannot fall
      into the collective delusion that Abstracted Accounts will be the magic
      bullet to solve user problems. Much like Ethereum's L1 <em>may</em> become
      intrinsically tied to Lido if it does not take collective action, and SAFE
      having to understand whether it is intrinsically tied WorldCoin & OP due to the
      2 million SAFE contracts that were deployed to Optimism, we cannot allow
      ourselves to become a victim of short-term incentives in lieu of hard,
      often subjective, work. The collective choices we make today will
      determine if the ecosystem stays true to its core decentralization
      principles or gradually shifts towards outright commercialization—and the
      centralization risk that comes with it.
